## Target Finder
The aim of this step is to train the agent to be able to find target in an environment where multiple paths lead to the target. The target is rewarded for finding the target and is penalized for every minute of time wasted. It is also penalized for driving out of the road.

## Landscape
The roads form a grid with boarder lines of the cells in the grid as the driveway and the cell. The target is a single point on the road.

## Variables
